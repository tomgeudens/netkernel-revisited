{endpoint}jena.RDFQueryModelDESCRIBE{/endpoint}

The ''jRDFQueryModelDESCRIBE'' accessor performs an SPARQL DESCRIBE query on a Jena model.

The results is returned as a [[doc:mod:rdf:jena:IRepJenaModel|IRepJenaModel]].

The '''operator''' specifies the SPARQL DESCRIBE query, for example

{literal}
DESCRIBE ?x
WHERE { ?x <http:/some/property> "value" }
{/literal}

==Optional Operand Argument==

If the ''operand'' argument is provided the query will be made against the operand model.

If the operand argument is omitted it is assumed that the query references a resource in the FROM part of the query statement.
Referenced resources will be SOURCEd from the ROC domain so that querys can be made from ROC domain resources, as well as external HTTP
resources (if the http client module is resolvable in context).
