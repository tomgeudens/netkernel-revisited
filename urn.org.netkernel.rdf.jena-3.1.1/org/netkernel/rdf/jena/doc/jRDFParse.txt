{endpoint}jena.RDFParseAny{/endpoint}

The ''jRDFParse'' accessor attempts to parse all serializations of RDF.

The appropriate parser is selected based upon type inferencing for the '''operand''' resource.

The inference first attempts to identify the type from the MimeType/ContentType of the resource.  If this is not
known then file extension matching will be attempted.  If both of these cannot resolve the type
then it will be assumed to be XML/RDF.

The response representation of this accessor is an [[doc:mod:rdf:jena:IRepJenaModel|IRepJenaModel]].
