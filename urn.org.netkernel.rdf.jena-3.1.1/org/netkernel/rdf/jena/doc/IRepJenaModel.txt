{endpoint}org.netkernel.rdf.jena.rep.IRepJenaModel{/endpoint}

The tools and services of this RDF/Jena library use the IRepJenaModel as the common representation type.

It is a wrapper over the Jena [http://jena.sourceforge.net/javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/rdf/model/Model.html|Model].
It ensures that the underlying Model is marked to be used only in a readonly immutable manner (getReadOnly)
or is safely cloned if mutation is to be performed (getModel).

{java}
public interface IRepJenaModel
{ /**
   * Get the RDF Model - this must be for readonly operations
   * it is not safe to modify this model.
   */
  Model getModelReadOnly();

  /**
   * Get a clone of the RDF Model - the returned model is
   * mutable and safe for updates.
   */
  Model getModel();
}
