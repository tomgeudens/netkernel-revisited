{endpoint}jena.RDFQueryModelSELECT{/endpoint}

The ''jRDFQueryModel'' accessor performs an RDQL query on a Jena model and
returns the results as an XML results set.  If a '''model''' argument is provided (with an arbitrary
value) then the results will be returned as a  [[doc:mod:rdf:jena:IRepJenaModel|IRepJenaModel]].

The '''operator''' specifies the SPARQL SELECT query, for example

{literal}
SELECT ?x
WHERE { ?x <http:/some/property> "value" }
{/literal}

The XML form of the results looks like...

{xml}
<sparql xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/sparql-results#">
  <head>
    <variable name="x"/>
  </head>
  <results>
    <result>
      <binding name="x">
        <uri>http://www.1060.org/bugxter/</uri>
      </binding>
    </result>
    <result>
      <binding name="x">
        <uri>http://www.1060.org/forum/</uri>
      </binding>
    </result>
  </results>
</sparql>
{/xml}

==Optional Operand Argument==

If the ''operand'' argument is provided the query will be made against the operand model.

If the operand argument is omitted it is assumed that the query references a resource in the FROM part of the query statement.
Referenced resources will be SOURCEd from the ROC domain so that querys can be made from ROC domain resources, as well as external HTTP
resources (if the http client module is resolvable in context). 

For example, active resources are supported like this:

{literal}
SELECT ?s ?p ?o
FROM <active:myDynamicRDFService+foo@baa>
WHERE { ?x <http:/some/property> "value" }
{/literal}
