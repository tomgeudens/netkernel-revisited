{endpoint}org.netkernel.rdf.jena.rep.IRepJenaDataset{/endpoint}

Some tools and services of this RDF/Jena library use the IRepJenaDataset as the representation type for a Collection of Models.

It is a wrapper over the Jena [http://jena.sourceforge.net/javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/rdf/model/Dataset.html|Dataset].
It ensures that the underlying Model is marked to be used only in a readonly immutable manner (getReadOnly).

{java}
public interface IRepJenaDataset
{	/**
	 * Get the DataSet - this must be for readonly operations 
	 * it is not safe to modify this DataSet.
	 */
	Dataset getDatasetReadOnly();
}
