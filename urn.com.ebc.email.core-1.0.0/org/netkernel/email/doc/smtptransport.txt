{endpoint}SMTPTransport{/endpoint}

The SMTPTransport creates an SMTP server that will receive email delivery request 
(it does not act as an SMTP relay) and will issue a root request 
when it detects the arrival of a new email message.

{callout}
It is recommended that the port be a value greater than 1024 since on 
Unix hosts only the root account may open low-numbered ports.
If this SMTP transport must be available on the standard SMTP port
25, we we recommend that you configure an operating system firewall 
rule to tunnel port 25 to the operational port number.

'''Never''' run a Java server as root.
{/callout}


==Configuration==

The '''optional'' ''config'' parameter provides the specification for the mail transport folder

{xml}
<config>
	<hostname>smtp.mycompany.com</hostname>
	<port>port number</port>
</config>
{/xml}

If config is not present then the hostname will be set as the 
physical platform's hostname and port will default to 25000.


==Received Emails==

When a new email message is received a request is 
constructed and issued into the transports host address space.

smtp:message + from @ [ from address ] + to @ [ to address ] 

The transport creates a dynamically inserted address space 
[[doc:email:core:emailMessage:space|emailMessage:/]] into the superstack
prior to issuing the request.  
Therefore the handler of the smtp:message request may SOURCE various elements of the message 
directly from this transient message space.
